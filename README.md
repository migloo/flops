Flask Ops: production quality deployment for Flask Apps.

1. Create 'deploy' on the server with sudo rights.
2. Create a flask app, named app.py and push it to github.
3. Use fab create after having modified the json file. 
4. You still need manually install the required packages on the server virtual env.
